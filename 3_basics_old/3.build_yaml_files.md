# build yaml files

## kubectl api-resources
> get list of k8s resource objects and their relative `kind`

## kubectl api-version
> get list of k8s versioning

- the first thing to create a YAML is to find out which `kind` and
`apiVersion` match together.

## metadata
> only name of resource you want to create is required

## spec
> where all the actions is at! and it's different based on the type
> of resource you want to create it
