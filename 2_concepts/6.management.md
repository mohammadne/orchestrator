# kubernetes managemnt techniques

1. kubectl generators
2. the future of kubectl run
3. imperative vs declarative
4. three management approaches

## generators
> it's a helper template that creates spec or specification to apply them
> to k8s cluster based command line options which causes commands to have
> all default fields that we aren't specify and make using one-line commands
> alot easier

- kubectl commands have a little bit of automation behind them known as
generatoes

- the generator template is different based on type wheter it's a service,
deployment, job, cronjob or ... .

- generators are small (10-15 lines of yaml) which are bare minimum to get
things started. 

``` zsh
# dry-run will run commands but don't on the cluster and just try-it-out
# -o specifyies the output
kubectl create deployment sample --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml

# in a job, we don't have replicaset
kubectl create job sample --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml
```

the output of first command:
``` yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector: # determines how to select the pods inside deployment
    matchLabels:
      app: sample
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

the output of second command:
``` yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: sample
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: sample
        resources: {}
      restartPolicy: Never # important
status: {}
```

let's try it for services:
``` zsh 
kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image nginx
kubectl expose deployment/my-nginx --port 80 --dry-run -o yaml
```

the output will be:
``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: my-nginx
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: my-nginx
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

## future of run command

- the goal is that it will be appropiate to only create pods and
right now it defaults to crating deployment with warnings and it
has lots of generators but they are all deprecated

- it's intended for use of simple dev/test pods

- before: creates a deployment generator

- after: creates a pod generator so it's intended to use create for 
deployment

``` zsh
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx --dry-run
# deployment.apps/my-nginx created (dry run)
```

``` zsh
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx --port 80 --expose --dry-run
# service/my-nginx created (dry run)
# deployment.apps/my-nginx created (dry run)
```

``` zsh
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx --restart OnFailure --dry-run
# job.batch/my-nginx created (dry run)
```

``` zsh
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx --restart Never --dry-run
# pod/my-nginx created (dry run)
```

## imperative vs declarative

### imperative
> focus on how a program operates for example what steps
> you done when you want to cook a food (precedure)

- examples: kubectl run, kubectl create deployment, kubectl update

- easier when you know the state

- easier to get started and better for human mind

- not easy to automate

### declarative
> focus on what a program should accomplish for example
> ordering specific food at resturant (result)

- example: kubectl apply -f my-resource.yaml

- we only specify the end result (yaml content)

- same commands each time

- more ability to set specifications

- easiest way to automate orchestration

## three management approaches

1. imperative commands: `run`, `expose`, `scale`, `edit`, `create` which
are good for dev/leaning but hard to manage over time

2. imperative objects: `create -f file.yaml`, `replace -f file.yaml`, 
`delete` and ... which are good for sma;; environments and can store
your changes in git-based yaml files but it's hard to automate

3. declarative objects: `apply -f file.yaml` or `dir\`, `diff` which
is best for production and easy to automate but harder to understand
and predict changes because you don't know the previous state of system
