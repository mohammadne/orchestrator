## terminology

### kubernetes
> the whole orchestration system (single or multi server) with
> all the parts together, it's like a micro-plugins to add them as a container 
> on top of docker it's also called k8s or kube for short and using 
> `cube control` as it's official pronunciation.

### kubectl
> CLI to configure k8s and manage apps, we use it to talk to k8s API, 

### node
> single server in kubernetes cluster

### kubelet
> it's a container running a litle agent on each node to allow 
> that node to talk to k8s master, the swarm doesn't need agent
> but k8s is built on top of that, needs it's own engine API to talk to 
> local docker or local runtime which talks to control plane which is 
> in charge of running k8s cluster.

### control plane (master)
> set of containers to manage the cluster or
> it's in charge of running cluster includes: API server, schedular, 
> controller manager, etcd and more.

## nodes and machines kind 

### master

1. `etcd`: distributed storage system for key-values (like RAFT algorithm)

2. `API`: the way we talk to cluster, API server implements an interface, 
which means different tools and libraries can readily communicate with it.

3. `schedular`: in this container control how and where containers are
placed on the nodes in objects called `pods`

4. `controller manager`: looks at state of whole cluster and everything
in it and uses `API` to do that, it takes the orders that are giving to it
named `specs` and determines the difference between what you're asking it
to do and waht's actually going on then it figures out how to make changes

5. `core DNS`: controll DNS


### node

1. `docker`: helps in running the encapsulated application containers 
in a relatively isolated but lightweight operating environment.

2. `kublet`: this is a small service in each node responsible for 
relaying information to and from control plane service. It interacts 
with etcd store to read configuration details and wright values.

3. `kube-proxy`: control the networking and helps in making services 
available to the external host
