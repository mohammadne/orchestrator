# storage in kubernetes

- contaienrs are `stateless`, means you can thrown them away and
when you update and ..., you'll lose every thing in it.

- storage and `stateful` workloads are harder in all systems.

- `StatefulSets` is a new resource type, making pods more sticky.

- avoid stateful workloads for first few deployments until you're good at
the basics. for first deployments, keep things simple.

## Volumes

- tied to lifecycle of a Pod

- all containers in a single Pod can share them

## PersistentVolumes

- created at cluster level, outlives a Pod.

- seperates storage config from Pod using it.

- multiple Pods can share them.

## CSI (Container Storage Interface)

- plugins are a new way to connect to storage so any storage vendor, can create
a plugin that you would install on any nodes you want (can be different in nodes)
and all of them will operate on a standard API that CSI provides and containers
can use that plugin to get their storage
