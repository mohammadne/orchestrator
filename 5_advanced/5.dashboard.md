# kubernetes dashboard

- it's important for any orchestrator to have a web GUI and for ex
if you run a multi-server system, you'd need some sort of GUI nterface
to gives you some visualization

- [default GUI for upstream k8s](https://githubhttps://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)

- some distros have their own GUI (Rancher, Docker Ent, OpenShift)

-clouds don't have it by default
