# Healtch Checks

- if application is malfunction, it's possible that pods are still running and will
not restart.

- we should always expose health check to outside to check availability and 
resiliency of the app.

- we have two type of health checks: via `command` or `URL`

## livenessProbes

> indicate whether a container is running

- if check fails, the container will be restarted

## readinessProbes

> indicates whether the container is ready to server requests

- if the check fails, the container will not be restarted, but the Pod's IP
address will be removed from the service, so it'll not serve any requests more.

- the pod will be ready only after readinessProbe sucess signal.
