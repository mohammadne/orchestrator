# DNS

- as k8s 1.3, DNS is a built-in `service` launched automatically using `addon` manager

- the `addon` are in the `/etc/kubernetes/addons` directory on `master` node

- DNS service will be used within pods to find other services running on the same cluster

- multiple containers in a pod don't need this service as they can contact each other
directly under the same wing via localhost

- (important) to make DNS work, pods need service definition

- service discovery uses the name of the service to find ip address of the pod, also
the built-in service discovery can do a `dns lookup` to find out ip of other pods by
doing a `host service-name.default`, the default here means default namespace.

- (intersting), if you run a `busybox` as a testing container and do `cat /etc/resolv.conf`
you will then see `nameserver 10.0.0.10` which points to the `dns-server` which behind the
scene is the default dns-server in k8s, it points to a pod named `kube-dns` which k8s built
it in `kube-system` namespace. 

## DEMO ooooooooo

1. create a mysql deployment

2. create service for mysql named: mysql-service

3. create a nodejs app deployment

4. create external nodejs-service named: nodejs-service

5. pass the address of mysql service to nodejs to connect to the mysql

6. get into mysql and check whether there's new records from node-js app:
    - `kubectl exec database -itt -- mysql -u root -p`
    - show databases;
    - use my-db;
    - show tables;
    - select * from hits;
    - \q

7. run a testing busybox pod:
    - `kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh`
    - nslookup
    - as you know the dns-server in k8s will resolve this domain to the actual pod ip
    and `nslookup` will gives you the ip of both `dns-server` and `host-pod` like:

        ``` sh
        nslookup nodejs-service
        # server: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local
        # name: 10.0.0.52 nodejs-service.default.svc.cluster.local

        nslookup mysql-service
        # server: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local
        # name: 10.0.0.123 mysql-service.default.svc.cluster.local
        ```

    so in above we hit dns server defind in `busybox etc nameserver` and find the answer
    - telnet or curl the service:
    
        ``` sh
        telnet nodejs-service 3000
        GET /
        # HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        ```
    
    - so in the cluster you can see `services` are `host-names` or `domains`
