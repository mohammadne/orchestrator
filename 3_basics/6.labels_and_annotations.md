# Labels and Annotations

## Labels

- under `metadata` in YAML

- simple `key:value` for identifying and describing objects or
resource later by selecting, grouping and filtering

- examples: `tier:fontend`, `app:api`, `env:prod` and ... .

- filter a get command: `kubectl get pods -l app=nginx` which will
applied only on maching labels

### selector Labels
> how one object finds the resources that it wants to talk to
> or do something with it. ex: a service needs to talk to pods
> so it needs to find a way to get those and it uses selectors
> as essentially as pattern matching to match the labels the
> keys and values there

- the `glue` telling `Service`s and `Deployment`s which pods are theirs

- selector are used to link resource dependencies

- use labels and selectors to control which pods go to which nodes
