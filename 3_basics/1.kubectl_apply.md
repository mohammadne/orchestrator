# kubectl apply

- it's the way we run declarative objects

- it's used for create/update resource:
    ```zsh
    # file
    kubectl apply -f file.yaml

    # directory
    kubectl apply -f dir/

    # url
    kubectl apply -f https://domain.com/file.yaml
    ```

## git-ops
> is all about storing yaml and configs in git repos and using
> git-commits to change infrastructure, in other way it's just
> about applying automation style of devops to configs which in
> kubernetes is by yaml files
