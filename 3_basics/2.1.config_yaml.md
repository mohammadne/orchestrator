# kubernetes configuration YAML

- format is in YAML (better for humans) and JSON (better for computers)
and the standard for k8s is YAML and k8s converts it to JSON

- you can mix and match these files, you can have different resources
in a single file or have single file per resource so each file contains
one or more `manifest(s)`

- each `manifest` describes an API object (deployment, job, secret) so
the full description of a resource is the manifest and that manifest has
requirements as four root key:value pairs in the file, `root` means at
the very begining of the line which are: 
`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec`
