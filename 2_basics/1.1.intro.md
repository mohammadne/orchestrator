## what is kubernetes ?

- it's a popular container orchestrator

- it takes nodes and decide how to run container workloads on nodes

- released by Google

- it's a series of containers on top of docker containers and manage
multi-node systems, CLI's and configs.

- provides API/CLI (kube control) to manage containers across servers

- many clouds provide it for you

## why kubernetes ?

- why you need orchestration, you may want a single node

- servers + application change rate => benefit of orchestration

- decide which orchestration? swarm or kubernetes

- if kubernetes then decide:

    - cloud

    - self-managed (docker enterprise, rancher, openshift, canonical, VMware PKS)

## kubernetes vs swarm

- [good link](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/10075/what-is-containerd-and-how-does-it-relate-to-docker-and-kubernetes/)

- both solves container orchestrators and both run on top of container runtime

- swarm is easy to deploy, manage and get-started

- kubernetes has more features and flexibility and customization so it gives
us more support and power

- understand your requirements and decide which is better for you

## swarm advantages

- comes with docker

- less complexity, less resources needed

- easiest orchestrator to deploy/manage yourself

- follows 80/20 rule: 20% of features and 80% of usecases

- runs every-where: local, cloud or datacenter and any platform

- secure by default (db, tls, plane channel)

- easier to troubleshoot

## kubernetes advantages

- clouds will deploy and manage kubernetes for you and
it's the first vendor support

- widest vendor and cloud support

- covers widest set of usecases
