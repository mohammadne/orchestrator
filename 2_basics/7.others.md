## kubectl apply

- it's the way we run declarative objects

- it's used for create/update resource:
    ```zsh
    # file
    kubectl apply -f file.yaml

    # directory
    kubectl apply -f dir/

    # url
    kubectl apply -f https://domain.com/file.yaml
    ```

## git-ops

> is all about storing yaml and configs in git repos and using
> git-commits to change infrastructure, in other way it's just
> about applying automation style of devops to configs which in
> kubernetes is by yaml files

## kubernetes configuration YAML

- format is in YAML (better for humans) and JSON (better for computers)
and the standard for k8s is YAML and k8s converts it to JSON

- you can mix and match these files, you can have different resources
in a single file or have single file per resource so each file contains
one or more `manifest(s)`

- each `manifest` describes an API object (deployment, job, secret) so
the full description of a resource is the manifest and that manifest has
requirements as four root key:value pairs in the file, `root` means at
the very begining of the line which are: 
`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec`

## build yaml files

### kubectl api-resources
> get list of k8s resource objects and their relative `kind`

### kubectl api-version
> get list of k8s versioning

- the first thing to create a YAML is to find out which `kind` and
`apiVersion` match together.

### metadata
> only name of resource you want to create is required

### spec
> where all the actions is at! and it's different based on the type
> of resource you want to create it

## build yaml spec

### [official kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/)

### kubectl explain services --recursive
> get all the keys each kind support

### kubectl explain services.spec
> get all the spec keys with description 

### kubectl explain services.spec.type
> get all the spec keys related to type with description 

### kubectl explain deployment.spec.template.spec.volumes.nfs.server
> get sub-spec keys

## dry-run and diff

- `dry-run a create` is only on client side

### dry-run on client side
``` zsh
kubectl apply -f 2.4.app.yaml --dry-run
```

### dry-run on server side
``` zsh
kubectl apply -f 2.4.app.yaml --server-dry-run
```

### apply it on server and dry-run on server side
``` zsh
kubectl apply -f 2.4.app.yaml
kubectl apply -f 2.4.app.yaml --server-dry-run
```

### see difference between pre apply and current (changes)
``` zsh
kubectl diff -f 2.4.app.yaml
```
