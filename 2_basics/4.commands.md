# basic kubernetes commands

- kubernetes is evolving and there are lots of options in it and
there are lots of ways to do the same thing.

- unlike some docker tools it allows to do the things on your team
workflow and their preference.

- the way to deploy pods (containers) are via commands or YAML file.

## kubctl run

- similar to `docker run`

- only for pod cration

### run workaround
``` zsh
# check version
kubectl version

# run nginx pod
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx

# list pods
kubectl get pods

# list all kubernetes objects (pods and services)
kubectl get all

# delete my-nginx pod
# we specify type of object to deployment
kubectl delete deployment my-nginx
```

- levels of abstraction objects: `Pods` < `ReplicaSet` < `Deployment`

> Deployment controller: manages ReplicaSet configuration
>
> ReplicaSet controller: make sure the number of pods we asked for 
> are currently running with the identical template

- you can manage different controllers but in most of the time you are
only configure development controller and it take care of the rest.

### scaling ReplicaSets
``` zsh
# create httpd pod
kubectl run my-apache --image httpd

# scale httpd replicas
# 2 same equivalent commands
kubectl scale deploy/my-apache --replicas 2
kubectl scale deployment my-apache --replicas 2

# get logs
kubectl logs deployment/my-apache

# l flag is stands-for label that run command applied
kubectl logs -l run=my-apache

# specify a pod itself
kubectl describe pod/<pod-name>

# temporarily delete a pod
kubectl delete pod/<pod-name>
```

whats going on in `control plane`:
1. deployment updated to 2 replicas
2. replicaSet controller sets pod count to 2
3. control plane assigns node to pod
4. kublet sees pod is needed, starts another container


- `selecter`: see logs combined for multiple pods, the selecter is a technique
to grab multiple pods based on a label that they are share, when you run pods,
the kubectl automatically added a label of the name of the deployment to all
those pods.

- when you delete a pod, the replicaset controller will create another 
substitude for that removed pod.

## kubctl create

- similar to `docker swarm create`

- create some resources via CLI or YAML

## kubctl apply

- similar to `docker stack deploy` on swarm

- create/update anything via YAML
