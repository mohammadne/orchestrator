# basic kubernetes container abstractions

- in kubernetes we have more layers of abstractions rather that swarm and docker


## Pod 

> basic unit of deployment, containers are always in pods.
>
> it's about one or more containers running together on one node
>
> we don't deploy containers directly, containers are always in pods

- when we create a pod, it also creates a replicaSet and deployment

## Controller

> for creating, updating (control) pods and other objects on top of pods
> and you almost always use controllers to deploy your pods instead of 
> directly deploy pods
>
> it validates k8s and is responsible to do what you asked from k8s and
> it's a differencing system
>
> there are many types of controller like:
> deployments, replicaset, statefulset, daemongset, job, cronjob and ...

## Service

> it's a network endpoint to connect to a pod means that you give
> endpoins to a set of pods often when you use a controller like a
> deployment controller to deploy a set of replica-pods you would
> then set a service on that, means you give it a persistance endpoint
> in the cluster so that everything else can access that set of pods

> at a specific DNS name and port

- you need to be able to access app from outside like adding a load-balancer

- there are other solutions for cloud providers that don't need a LB like using
a `haproxy` or `nginx` load-balancer in front of cluster or you can expose ports
directly (not recommanded)

- you can point a hostname to ELB to reach your pod from internt

## Namespace

> filtered group of objects in cluster or it's a filter
> on your view at the command line 

## Other concepts

there are lot more concepts like:
- secrets, configMaps, ...
