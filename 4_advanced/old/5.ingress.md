- we managed the above issues with ingress (project)

- it's not installed by default on k8s cluster but there are official features
for it, the way this works is k8s didn't invent HTTP-Proxy and they just provide
mechanisms for other 3rd-party proxies to use features so that you install the
ingress in your cluster.

- ingress controllers (opional) do this with 3rd party proxies

- try an example with: Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, F5, Envoy, Istio and ...

- you can say your apps how to use that proxy to get to your container

- developers put annotations into their YAML that are needed for the ingress
controller to figure out what to do with them (how to route, what's the right path)
