# CRD's

- some 3rd parties don't use k8s API and now with custom resources and
custom controllers you can change the API.

- use the API to extend the API and add commands to `kubectl` and see
new resource types and new controllers

## operator pattern

- the above pattern (extending API) is known as Operator-Pattern which
was first introduced bu `CoreOS`

- a pattern is starting to emerge of using these together.

- operator automate deployment and managment of complex apps

- ex: for a monitoring solution like promotheus you may need jobs, services
deployments and ... and now companies extend the k8s and `kubectl` can operate
on those tools

databases, monitoring tools, backups and custom ingresses
