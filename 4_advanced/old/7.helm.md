# Higher Deployment Abstractions

- as you know kubernetes is expanding and the binaries and base infrastructure
of k8s, the rings keep getting big and bigger with `operator pattern`

- all our `kubectl` commands just talk to the kubernetes API.

- k8s has limited built-in templating, versioning, tracking and managment of
your apps.

- there are now over 60 ways, to add tools on top of k8s simply for deploying
applications on k8s like: `Jenkins` and `Helm charts`.

## Helm

> the de facto way

- most popular deployment tool

## Templating YAML

- many of the deployment tools have templating options

- you'll need a solution as the number o fenvironmnets/apps grow

- `Helm` was the first winner in the space but it's a little complex

- official `Kustomize` feature works out-of-the-box
