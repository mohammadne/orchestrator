# Node Architecture

- containers in a `pod` can communicate with each other using `localhost` and target `port` number

- pods in a cluster can also communicate with each other but it should goes throw the 
network and `service discovery`

- `kube-proxy` will feed the `ip-tables` by giving it the information about what pods are
running on this node and `ip-tables` acts like a firewall that can route the traffic also
it make sure the pods are routable inside the cluster

- the load-balancer will route the traffic to our cluster
