# ConfigMap

- config parameters that are not secret, can be put in a configMap

- it's key-value pairs that can be read via:
    - container commandline arguments
    - volumes
    - environment variables

- it can slso contain full configuration files like webserver config file

- config file can be mounted using volumes where application read configs from,
this way you can inject configuration settings into containers without changing
the container itself.

- suppose you have a file and you want to create configMap:
    - `kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=path-to-file`

## expose ConfigMap

1. using volumes

    ``` yaml
    # ...
        # ...
        volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /etc/config
    volumes:
        - name: config-volume
            configMap:
                name: app-config
    # ...
    ```

2. environment variables

    ``` yaml
    # ...
        # ...
        env:
            - name: DRIVER
                valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                        name: app-config
                        key: driver
            # ... other envs
    ```

## DEMO oooo

1. kubectl create configmap nginx-config --from-file=configmap/reverseproxy.conf

2. kubectl get configmap nginx-config -o yaml

3. create a deployment with 2 containers on the same pod, one is our nodejs app and
another one is nginx reverse-proxy which will redirect traffic to port 80 of the pod
to port 3000 of nodejs app which means we add reverse-proxy in-front of the nodejs app

4. we will mount configMap data to nginx `/etc/nginx/conf.d` path to be used by nginx
