# Secrets

- provides a way in k8s to disttribute credentials, keys, passwords or any secret data to the pods.

- k8s internally uses this secrets to provide the credentials to access the internal API in the
`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`

- secrets (k8s's secret) is only one way to provide secrets, native to k8s and there are still other ways
your container can get secrets like external `vault` service

## using secrets

1. you can use them as environment variables

2. use secrets as a file in a pod
    - it uses volumes to be mounted in a container
    - in this volume you have files
    - can be used for instance for `dotenv` files or your app can just read this file

3. use an external image to pull secrets (from private image-registry)

## generate secrets (files)

1. using command-line

2. using yaml (`base64` encoded values)

## use secrets

1. create a pod that exposes the secrets as environment variables

2. provide it as a file:

- the dafault k8s uses this mechanism to provide secrets
