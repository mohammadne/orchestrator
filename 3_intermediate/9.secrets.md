# Secrets

- provides a way in k8s to disttribute credentials, keys, passwords or any secret data

- k8s internally uses this secrets to provide the credentials to access the internal API

- secrets is only one way to provide secrets, native to k8s and there are still other ways
your container can get secrets like external `vault` service

## using secrets

1. you can use them as environment variables

2. use secrets as a file in a pod
    - it uses volumes to be mounted in a container
    - in this volume you have files
    - can be used for instance for `dotenv` filesor your app can just read this file

3. use an external image to pull secrets (from private image-registry)

## create secrets

1. using command-line

``` zsh
echo -n "root" > ./usename.txt
echo -n "password" > ./password.txt
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=./username.txt --from-file=./password.txt
```

2. using yaml file
    - you should put `base64` encoded values

## use secrets

1. you can create a pod that exposes the secrets as environment variables

``` yaml
#...
env:
    - name: SECRET_USENAME
    valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
            name: db-secret
            key: username
    - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
    # ...
# ...
```

2. provide it in a file:

- the dafault k8s uses this mechanism to provide secrets

``` yaml
# pod or deployment spec ...
    # containers spec ...
    VolumeMounts:
    - name: credVolume
    mountPath: /etc/creds
    readOnly: true
volumes:
    - name: credVolume
    secret:
        secretName: db-secrets
# ...
```
