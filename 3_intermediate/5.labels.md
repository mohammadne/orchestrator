# Lables

- labels are key/value pairs that can be attached to objects

- it's like tags for tagging any resource

- they are not unique and an object can have multiple labels

- `Label Selectors`: we attache them to objects to narrow down the results also
we can use `matching expressions` to match labels

- simple `key:value` for identifying and describing objects or
resource later by selecting, grouping and filtering

- examples: `tier:fontend`, `app:api`, `env:prod` and ... .

- filter a get command: `kubectl get pods -l app=nginx` which will
applied only on maching labels

## run a pod on specific nodes

1. tag the node

    ``` zsh
    kubectl label nodes node-name hardware=high
    ```

2. using `noodeSelector` to let pod only run on them

### selector

> how one object finds the resources that it wants to talk to
> or do something with it. ex: a service needs to talk to pods
> so it needs to find a way to get those and it uses selectors
> as essentially as pattern matching to match the labels the
> keys and values there

- the `glue` telling `Service`s and `Deployment`s which pods are theirs

- selector are used to link resource dependencies

- use labels and selectors to control which pods go to which nodes
