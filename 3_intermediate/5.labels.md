# Lables

- labels are key/value pairs that can be attached to objects

- it's like tags for tagging any resource

- they are not unique and an object can have multiple labels

- `Label Selectors`: we attache them to objects to narrow down the results also
we can use `matching expressions` to match labels

## run a pod on specific nodes:
1. tag the node

    ``` zsh
    kubectl label nodes node-name hardware=high
    ```

2. using `noodeSelector` to let pod only run on them

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        # ...
    spec:
        containers:
        # ...
        nodeSelector:
            hardware: high
    ```
