# Services

- pods are dynamic, means they can come and terminated in the cluster

- when using RC, pods are terminated and created during scaling operations

- when using Deployments, when updating the image version, pods are terminated
and new pods take the place of older pods.

- so pods should be accessed via a service

- `service` is the logical-bridge between the pods and other services or end-users

- creating a service will create an endpoint for your pod(s):
    - `ClusterIp`: virtual Ip reachable inside the cluster
    - `NodePort`: a port that is the same on each node that is also reachable externally
    - `LoadBalancer`: created by cloud-provider that will route external traffic to every node
        on the NodePort (ELB on AWS)

- there is also possibility to use `DNS names`
    - external-name can provide a DNS name for the service like service discovery useing DNS
    - only works when `DNS add-on` is enabled

- by default service can only run between ports 30000-32767 but you could change this behavior
by addng the --service-node-port-range arg to the `kube-apiserver` (init script of master node)

- service will automatically assign a random port to the NodePort but you can assign port
manually by `nodePort` option (handle collisions manually)
